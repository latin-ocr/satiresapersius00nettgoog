ΟΝ THE

LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS ·

Delzbered ¹ot Oxfhra', Januaryt 24, 1855.

Ῑτ is my intention for the present to deliver general lectures from time
to time on the characteristies of some of the authors whom I may
select as subjects for my terminal courses. To those who propose to

attend my classes they will serve as prolegomena, grouping together ,

various matters which will meet us afterwards as they lie scattered up
and down the course of our expository readings, and giving the point
of view from which they are to be regarded: to others 1 trust they may

not be without their use as Sketches Historical and Literary, complete ’

in themselves, in which an attempt will be made to bring out the
various features and circumstances of each author into a broad general
light, and exhibit the interest which they possess when·considered
independently of critical minutiae.

The writer of whom I am to speak today is one who, as it seems

to me, supplies ample materials both for detailed study and for a more ⁴

transient survey. It is a very superficial criticism which would pretend
that the reputation of Persius is owing simply to the labour which has
been spent upon him: still, where the excellence olan author is un·
doubted, the difficulties oi his thought or his language are only so
many additional reasons why the patient and prolonged study ol him
is sure to be profitable. The difficulties ol Persius, too, have the
advantage of being definite and unmisrakable-like those of Aeschylus,
not like those ol Sophocles-difficulties which do not elude the grasp,
but close with it fairly, and even if they should be still unvanquished,
