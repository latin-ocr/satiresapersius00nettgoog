’ are constantly accustomed to look in the absence of anything more
directly conclusive. The memoir of Persius mentions Lucilius, but
says not aword of Horace: the quotations from Horace in the com-
mentary of the pseudo-Comutus are, as l have said, far from numerous:
while the difference of the poets themselves, their personal history, their
philosophica] profession, their taste and temperament, the nature and
power of their genius, is greater even than in the case of Persius and
Lucilius, and is only more clearly brought out by the clearer know-
ledge we possess of each, in the possession of the whole of their
respective works. The fact, however, is only too palpable-so much
so that it puzzles us, as it were, hy its very plainness: we could under-
stand a less degree of imitation, but the correspondence which we
actually see makes us, so to speak, half incredulous, and compels us to
seek some account of it. It is not merely that we find the same topics
in each, the same class of allusions and illustrations, or even the same
thoughts and the same images, but the resemblance or identity extends
to things which every poet, in virtue of his own peculiarities and those
of his time, would naturally be expected to provide for himself. With
him, as with Horace, a miser is a man who drinks vinegar sor wine,
and stints himself in the oil which he pours on his vegetables3 while
a contented man is one who acquiesces in the prosperity of people
whose start in life is worse than his own. The prayer of the farmer is
still that he may turn up a pot of money some day while he is plough·
ing: the poet's hope is still that his verses may be embalmed with
cedar oil, his worst sear still that they may furnish wrapping for
spices. Nay, where he mentions names they are apt to be the names
of Horatian personages: his great physician is Craterus his grasping
rich man Nerius, his crabbed censor Bestius, his low reprobate Natta.
Something is doubtless due to the existence of what, to adopt a term
applied by Colonel Mure to the Greek epic writers, we may call
satirical commonplace, just as Horace himself is thought to have taken
the name Nomentanus from Lucilius; or as, among our own satirists,
Bishop Hall talks of Labe0, and Pope of Gorgonius. So Persius may
have intended not so much to copy Horace as to quote him-advertis-
ing his readerS, as it were, from time to time that he was using the
language of satire. But the utmost that can be proved is, that he
followed prodigally an example which had been set sparingly, not
knowing or not remembering that satire is a kind of composition
which of all others is kept alive not by antiquarian associations, but
by contemporary interest-not by generalized conventionalitieS, but
by direct individual purtraiture. We can hardly doubt that a wider
