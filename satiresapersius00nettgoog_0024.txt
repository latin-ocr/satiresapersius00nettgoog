LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xvii

the annals of the empire, Maecenas and Sejanus. His father was of
equestrian rank, and his relatives included some of the first men of his
time. The connection of the family with his birth-place is substantiated
by two inscriptions which have been discovered there ¹, as its memory
was long preserved by a tradition professing to point out his residence,
and by the practice ofa noble house which was iu the habit of using .
his name. That name was already not unfamiliar at Rome, having
been borne by a contemporary of Lucilius, whose critical judgment
the old poet dreaded as that of the most learned man of the age, as
well as by a successful officer in the time of the Second Punic War.
Persius' early life was passed in his native town, a time to which he
seems to allude when he speaks of himself in his third satire as
evading the lessons in which he was expected to distinguish himself
by his admiring father, and ambitious only of eminence among his
playmates. When he was six years old his father died, and his
mother, Fulvia Sisennia,a genuine Etruscan name, found a second
husband, also of equestrian rank, called Fusius, who within a few
years left her a second time a widow. At twelve years of age Persius
was removed to Rome, where he studied under Remmius Palaemon
the grammarian, and Verginius Flavus the rhetorician. Of the latter,
we only know that he had the honour of being banished by Nero-
on account, so Tacitus sayS, of the splendour of his reputation-in
the burst of jealous fury which followed the conspiracy of Piso; that
he wrote the treatise on rhetoric, to which Quintilian so repeatedly
refers with respect ², and that he made a Jokeon a tedious rival,
asking him how many miles long his speech had been. Of the
former an odious character is given by Suetonius who says that his
extraordinary memory and facility of expression made him the most
popular teacher in Rome, but represents him as a man of inordinate
vanity and arrogance, and so infamous for his vices that both Tiberius
and Claudius openly declared him to be the last man who ought to be
trusted with the instruction of youth. The silence with which Persius
passes over this part of his experience may perhaps be regarded as
significant when we contrast it with the language in which he speaks
of the next stage in his education. It was, he tells us, when he first
laid aside the emblema of boyhood and assumed the toga-just at the
time when the sense of freedom beginS, and life is seen to diverge
into different paths—that he placed himself under another gulde.
