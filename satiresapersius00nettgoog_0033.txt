xxvi LECTURE ON THE

We have already observed that the character os Persius’ opinions
determined his choice os a poetical vehicle for expressing them. With
his views it would have been as unnatural lor him to have composed
a didactie treatise‚ like Lucretius, or a republican epic, like Lucan-as
to have rested satisfied with multiplying the productioris of his own boy-
hood‚ tragedies and pilgrimages in verse. And now, what was the
nature and what the historieal antecedents ol that form ol composition
which he adopted as most congenial to him?

The exploded derivation ol satire from the Greek satyric dmma is
one ol those infrequent instances where a false etymology has pre·
serveda significant truth. There seems every reason to believe that

θ . the first beginnings os satire among the Romans are parallel to the

rudimental type from which dramatic entertainments were developed
in Grceee. ‘When Ι arn reading on these two subjects,' says Dryden,
in his admirable essay on Satire, ‘methinks Ι hear the same story told
twice over with very little alteration? The primitive Dionysiae festivals
ol the Greeh rustic populations seem to have answered with sufficient
’ exactness to the harvest-horne rejoieings ol agricultural Italy described
by llorace, when the country wits encountered each other in Fescennino
verses. Nor did the resemblance cease at this its earliest stage. Im·
proviscd repartee was succeeded by pantomimic representation and
dancing to music, and in process ol time the two elementa combined
yet ‹liseriminated from each other, assumed the form of a regular play,
with ita alternate dialogues and cantz'ca. Previous to this later develop-
ment thcre had been an intermediate kind ol entertainment called
the satura or medley, either lrom the miscellaneous character of its
matter, which appears to have made no pretence to a plot or story,
or lrom the variety ol measures of which it was composed—a more
professional and artistic exhibition than the Fescennina bantering·
matchcs, but sar removed lrom the organized eompleteness ol even the
earlier drama. It was on this narrow ground that the independenee ol
the Roman genius was destined to assert itself. Whether from a wish
to take advantage ol the name, or to preserve a thing, once popular,
from altogether dying out in the process of improvement, a feeling
which we hnow to have operated in the caseos the exodia or interludes
introduced into the representation ol the Atellano plays, Ennius was
led to produce certain compositions which he called satires, seemingly
as various both in character and in versification as the old dramatic
medley, but intended not for acting but for reciting or reading-ln
other words, not plays but poems. All that we hnow of these is eom-
prised in a lew titles and a very lew fragments, none of which tell us
