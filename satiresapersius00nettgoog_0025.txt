This was Annaeus Cornutus, a Stoic philosopher of great name, who Ι
was himself afterwards banished by Nero for an uncourtly speech,-
a man who, like Probus, has become a sort of mythical critic, to
whom mistake or forgery has ascribed writings really belonging to
a much later period. The connection thus formed was never after·
ζ wards broken, and from that time Persius seems to bave declared
himself a disciple of Stoicism. The creed was one to which his
antecedents naturally pointed, as he was related to Arria, daughter
of that ‘true wife’ who taught her husband how to die, and herself

married to Thrasea, the biographer and imitator of the younger Cat0.
’ His literary profession was made soon after his edueation had been
completed. He had previously written several juvenile works-a
tragedy, the name of which has probably been lost bya corruption
in the MS. account of his life; a poem on Travelling (perhaps a
record of one of his tours with Thrasea, whose favourite and frequent
companion he was) in imitation of Horace's journey to Brundisium,
and ofa similar poem by Lucilius ; and a few verses commemorative
of the elder Arria. Afterwards, when he was fresh from his studies,
the reading of the tenth book of Lucilius diverted his poetical ambition
into a new channel,·and he applied himself eagerly to the composition
of satires after the model of that which had impressed him so strongly.
The later Scholiasts ¹, a class of men who are rather apt to evolve facts,
as well as their causes partly from the text itself which they have to
illustrate, partly from their general knowledge of human nature, tell
us that this ardour did not preclude considerable vacillation: he
deliberated whether to write or not, began and left off, and then
began again. One of these accounts says that be hesitated for some
time between a poetical and a military life-a strange but perhaps not
incredible story, which would lead us to regard the frequent attacks
on the army in his Satires not merely as expressions of moral or
constitutional antipathy, but as protests against a former taste of his
own, which may possibly have still continued to assert itself in spite
of the precepts of philosophy. He wrote slowly, and at rare intervals,
so that we may easily imagine the six Satires which we possess—an
imperfect work, we are told-to represent the whole of his career
as a professed author. The remaining notices of his life chiefly
respect the friends with whom his philosophical or literary sympathies
led him to associate. The earliest of these were Caesius Bassus, to
whom his sixth Satire is addressed-himselfa poet of some celebrity,
