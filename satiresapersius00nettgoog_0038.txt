LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxxi

Lucilius. On the ethical side we should have been hardly prepared to
expect much similarity: there is, however, a curious fragment of
Lucilius, the longest of all that have come down tous, containinga
simple recital of the various constituents of virtue, the knowledge of
duty no less than its practice, in itself sufficiently resembling the
enumeration of the elements ol morality which Persius makes on more
than one occasion, and showing a turn for doctrinal exposition which
was sure to be appreciated by a pupil of the Stoics So there are not
wanting indications that the bold metaphors and grotesque yet forcible
imagery which stamp the character of Persius' style so markedly may
have been encouraged if not suggested by hints in Lucilius, who was
fond of tentative experimenta in language, such as belong to the early
stages of poetry, when the national taste is in a state of fusion, The
admitted contrast between the two men, unlike ln all but their equestrian
dement—between the premature man of the world and the young
philosopher, the improvisatore who could throw off two hundred verses
in an hour, and the student who wrote seldom and slowly,-may
warrant us in doubting the success of the imitation, but does not dis-
credit the fact. Our point is, that Persius attempted to wear the toga
ol his predecessor, not that it fitted him.

The influence of Horace upon Persius is a topic which has, in part,
been anticipated aheady¹. It is a patent fact which may be safely
assumed, and 1 have naturally been led to assume it as a help towards
estimating other things which are not so easily ascertainable. Casaubon r
was, I believe, the first to bring it forward prominently into light in an
appendix to his memorable edition of Persius; and though one ol the
later commentators has endeavoured to call it in question, cautioning
us against mistaking slight coincidences for palpable imitations‚ I am
confident that a careful and minute study of Persius such as I have
lately been engaged in, will be found only to produce a more complete
conviction of its truth: nor can 1 doubt that an equally careful perusal
of Horace, line by line and word by word, would enable us to add
still further to the amount of proof. Yet it is curious and instructive
to observe that it is a point which, while established by a superabund-
ance of the best possible evidence, that of ocular demonstration, is yet
singularly deficient in those minor elements of probability to which we
