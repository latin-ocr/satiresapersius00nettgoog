ttte that he must have known, not from the descriptions ol a past age
but from his own experience‚ his portraits have au imaginative truth,
minutely accurate yet highly ideal, which would entitle them to a dis-
tinguished place in any poetical gallery. There is nothing in Horace ’
or Juvenal more striking than the early part of the third satire, where
the youthsul idler is at first represented by a series of light touches‚
snoring in broad noon while the harvest is baking in the fields and the

cattle reposing in the shade, then starting up and calling for his books
only to quarrel with them—and afterwards as we go further the scene
darkens, and we see the figure of the lost profligate blotting the back·
ground, and catch an intimation of yet more fearlul punishments in
store sor those who will not be warne'd in time-punishments dire as
any that the oppressors oi mankind have suffered or devised—the be·
holding oi virtue in her beauty when too late, and the consciousness oi
a corroding secret which no other heart can share. Nor would it be
easy to parallel the effect of the sketehes in the first satire, rapidly
succeeding each other,-the holiday poet with his white dress and his
onyx ring tuning his voice for recitation; a grey and bloated old man,
giving himself up to cater sor the itching ears ol others3 the jaded‚
worn company at the table, languidly rousiug themselves in the hope
oi some new excitement; the inferior guests at the bottom os the hall
ready to applaud when they have got the cue from theIr betters-·-all
flung into a startling and ghastly light by the recollection carelully
presented to us that these men call themselves the sons of the old
Romam, and recognise poetry as a divine thing, and acknowledge the
object ol criticism to be truth. Again we see the same pictorial skill
and reality, though in a very different style, toned down and sobered,
in those most sweet and touching lines describing the poet’s residence
with his beloved teacher, whenthey used to study together through
long summer suns and seize on the first and best hours of the night for
the social meal, each working while the other worked and resting while
the other rested,and both looking lorward to the modest enjoyrnent of
the evening as the crown of a well-spent day. Persius' language has
been censured for its harshness and exaggeration: but here, at any
rate, he is as simple and unaffected as an admirer of Horace or Virgil
could desire. The contrast is instructive, and may perhaps suggesta
more favourable view os those peculiarities ol expression which are
generally condemned. The style which his taste leads him to drop
when he is not writing satire, is the style which his taste leads him to
assume for satiric purposes. He leels that a clear, straightiorward,
everyday manner of speech would not suit a subject over which the
