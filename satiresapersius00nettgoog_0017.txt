, first sight easy to decide whether the reading is in mares or lei

⁴ mares. As regards orthography, this MS. is muchfreer from

mistakes than the MS. of Juvenal bound in the same cover
and apparently written by the same hand, in the tenth satire
of which I found such misspellings as gretia for Graecia,
canicies for canities, contentus for concentus, satia 'for socia, and
tlaamatulu for tomacula. This confusion between e and tis
almost unknown to the MS. of Persius: patritiae (Sat. 6. 73)
being perhaps the only instance of it. In Sat. 1. 116, how-

ever, it is difficult to make out whether the scribe has written

“ mreti or muci. The chief confusions of consonants which this

MS. exhibits are between b and p (obtare for aptare, rapiasa
for rabiosa): between g and gu (pingue for‘pinge, langues for
langasl: between saud ss (ammisus, asigna: cassiam, recusso
for casiam, recusa, etc.): between m and mm, p and pp, e and
cc (imitere for immittere, ammamis for amomis, suppellex for
supellex, quipe for quippe, peccari for pecori, etc). Among the
vowels, a and aare occasionally confused, as centurianuru,
Salonas for centurionum, Salarees: so with a and u (fumusa,
furtunare for fumosa, fortunare ,· supinus, conditer for supinus,
cande'tur): to say nothing of the interchange, common in such
MSS, of ae and e, yand i. The monosyllabic prepositions
are almost invariably joined with their nouns (etumula, in·
latrum, etc.) and sometimes even assimilated. The same is
often the case with monosyllabic conjunctions (cumscriba reau-
cacta, siuacet, etc). ln words compounded with in, the prepo-
sition is sometimes assimilated, sometimes not ; thus we find

inprimit, inprobe, conpassitum by the side of implerunt, impulit,

compassum. Ad, on the other hand, is generally assimilated:

arradens, afferre, assit, etc.
‘It is doubtful,’ says Mr. Conington, ‘whether this MS. was
