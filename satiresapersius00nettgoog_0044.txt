THE TEXT OF PERSIUS¹

.ΰὺ-

[Το judge from the praise bestowed upon him by Quintilian and
Martiam, and from the numerous quotations made from him by the
grammarians, Persius must have had a considerable number of readers
in the first four centuries after Christ. The palimpsest os Bobbio³
(now No. 5750 in the Vatican Library), a fragment of which still
exists, must have belonged to this early period.

In nn. 402 Flavius Julius Trytonianus Sabinus, a young man of

high rank, attempted, as he tells us in a subscriptio now preserved at -

the end of the two best manuscripts, to correct the text of Persius:

‘Flavius Julius Trylonianus Sabinus, v.c., protector domesticus,
⁵ temptavi emendare sine antigrapho meum et adnotavi Barcellone‚ coss.
dd. nn. Arcadio et Honorio V! It is important to observe that in the
Latinos this period, ‘emendare' implies not conjectural emendation
as we understand it, but bare correction ol such obvious errors as
abounded in most manuscripts, even the oldest, at that time. ‘Adno-
tatio' probably means the insertion of critical and explanatory notes.
The corrector generally made use of another copy (‘antigraphon’)
with which to compare his own3 but Sabinus is careful to tell us that
his work was personned without one.

At the time ol the Carolingian revival, and during the succeeding
centuries, many copies of Persius were made, and many still exist,
From these Jahn, who gave the readings of a great number in 1843,
selected three as the basis ol his text oi 1868. The three are, (Ι) Νο.
