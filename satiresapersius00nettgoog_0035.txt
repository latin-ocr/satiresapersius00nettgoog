xxviii LECTURE ON THE

suited to her direct practical genius, and to her mastery over the arts
os social lite. There can be no question but that the conception os
seizing the spirit oi comedy-of the new comedy no less than the old
—the comedy ol manners as well as the comedy of scurrilous bur·
lesque-and investing it with an easy undress clothing, the texture of
which might be varied as the inward feeling changed, was a great
advance in the progress of letters. It would seem to be a test of the
lawful development osa new form oi composition from an old, that the
latter should be capable os including the earlier, as the larger includes
the smaller. So in the development of the Shaksperian drama from

the Greek, the chorus is not lost either as a lyrical or as an ethical
element, but is diffused over the play, no longer seen indeed, but felt

in the art which heightens the tone ol poetry, and brings out the moral
relations oi the characters into more prominent relies. So in that
great development which transcends as it embraces all others, the
development oi prose from poetry, the superiority of the new form to
the old as a general vehicle os expression is shown in the expansive
flexibility which can find measured and rhythmic utterance for the
raptures of passion or imagination, yet give no undue elevation to the
statement of the plainest matters os lact. And so it is in the genera·
tion of satire lrorn comedy: the unwieldy lramework os the drama is
gone, hut the dramatic power remains‚ and may be summoned up at
any time at the pleasure ol the poet, not only in the impalpable shape
ol remarks on human character, hut in the ileshand-blood sulness of
actual dialogue such as engrosses several ol the satires os Horace, and
enters as a more or less important ingredient into every one of those
oi Persius. Or, if we choose to regard satire, as we are fully warranted
in doing, in its relation not only to the stage hut to other kinds oi
poetry, we shall have equal reason to admire it forits elasticity, as
being capable of rising without any ungraceful effort from light ridi·
cule to heightened earnestness—passing at once with Horace from a
ludicrous description oi a poet as a marked man, to an emphatic
recognition of his essential greatness; or with Juvenal from a sneer at
the contemptible offerings with which the gods were commonly pro·
pitiated, to a sublime recital of the blessings which may lawsully be
made objects oi prayer. This plastic comprehensiveness was realized
by the earlier writers, as we have seen, by means of the variety oi their
metreS, while the latter were enabled to compass it more artistically by
that skillul management of the hexameter which could not be brought
to perfection in a day. But the conception appears to have been
radically the same throughout, and the very name satura already con-
