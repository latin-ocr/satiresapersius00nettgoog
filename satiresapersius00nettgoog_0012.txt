PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

ΒΥ ΤΙ-ΙΕ EDITOR

...ῆς- .

F OR the third edition ol this volume the text and commen-

tary have been revised. In place ol the notes from the Gale
manuscript, formerly printed at the foot of the page, I have
inserted the apparatus criticus ol Jahn’s edition (1868) as re-
vised and reprinted by Biicheler in 1886. In explanation of
the apparatusl have added asew words on the text of Persius
(pp. xxxvii and xxxviii).

1 have carefully studied the ancient scholiis, and especially
the selection from thern printed by Biicheler at the loot of his

text (1886). In the general study of Persius’ age and
surroundingS‚ I have derived invaluable assistance froin Pro-

fessor J. E. Β. Mayor's recent edition of Juvenal, as well as
srorn Friedlander’s editions of Martial and Petronius' cena Tri-
malchionis. Iwish also to express my obligation to Pro-
fessor Gildersleeve’s edition (New York, Harper,187 5), and also
to three short treatises dealing especially with Persius. These
are, (1) by Dr. J. Bieger, De Auli Persii Codice Pithoeano C
recte aestimando, Berlin, 1890 3 (2) by Dr.J. van Wageningen,
Parsiana, Groningen, 18913 (3) by Dr. J. H. Ovink‚ Adversaris
ad Persii Prologum et Satiram Primam, Leyden,1886. T
