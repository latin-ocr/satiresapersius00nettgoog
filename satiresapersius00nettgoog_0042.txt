LIFE AND WRlTINGS OF PERSlUS. xxxv

gods themselves might hesitate whether to laugh or to weep. He has
to write the uagi-comedy ol his day, and he writes itin a dialect where
grandiose epic diction and philosophical terrninology are strangely
blended with the talk ol the forum, the gymnasia, and the barber's
shop. Ι suggest this consideration with the more confidence, as 1 find
it represented to me, aud, as it were, sorced on me by the example ol
a writer ol our own country, perhaps the most remarkable oi the pre·
sent time, who, though differiug as widely from Persius in all his
circumstances as a world-wearied and desponding man ol the ninc-
teenth century can differ from an enthusiastic and inexperienced youth
ol the first, still appears to me to bear a singular resemblance to him iu
the whole character ol his genius-I mean Mr. Carlyle. Il Persius
can take the benefit ol this parallel, he may salely plead guilty to the
charge ol not having escaped the vice ol his age, the passion for
refining still further on Augustan refinements ol expression, and loek-
ing up the meaning ol a sentence in epigrammatic allusions, which in
its measure lies at the door even ol Tacitus.

1 have exhausted my time and, Ι lear, your patience also, when my
subject is still far from exhausted. Ι am glad, however, to think that
in closiug I am not really bringing it to an end, but that some ol my
hearers today will accompany me tomorrow and on future days in
the special study ol one wh0, like all great authors, will surrender the

full knowledge oi his beauties only to those who ask it ol him in
detail
