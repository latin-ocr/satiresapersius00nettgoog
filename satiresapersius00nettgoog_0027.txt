himself worthy of his pupil's liberality by relinquishing the money

reviewing his works, recommending that the juvenile productions
should be destroyed, and preparing the Satires for publication by
a few slight corrections and the omission of some lines at the end,
which seemed to leave the work imperfect—perhaps, as Jahn supposes
the fragment of a new satire. They were ultimately edited by Caesius
Bassus, athis own request, and acquired instantaneous populariry.
The memoir goes on to tell us that Persius was beautiful in person,
gentle in manners, a man of maidenly modesty, an excellent son,
brother, and nephew, of frugal and moderate habits. This is all that
we know of his life—enough to give the personal interest which
a reader of his writings will naturally require, and enough, too, to
surnish a bright page to a history where bright pages are few.
Persius was a Roman, but the only Rome that he knew by experience
was the Rome of Tiberius Caligula, Claudius, and Nero-the Rome
which Tacitus and Suetonius have pourtrayed, and which pointed
St. Paul's denunciation of the moral state of the heathen world.
Stoicism was not regnant but militant-it produced not heroes or
statesmen, but confessors and martyrs ,· and the early death which cut
short the promise of its Marcellus could not in such an age be called

It was about two hundred years since a Stoic first appeared in
Rome as a member of the philosophie embassy which Athens de-
spatched to propitiate the conquering city. , Like his companions, he
was bidden to go back to his school and lecture there, leaving the youth
Ι of Rome to receive their education, as heretofore, from the magistrates
and the laws; but though the rigidity of the elder Cato triumphed for
a time, it was not sufficient effectually to exorcise the new spirit.
Panaetius, under whose influence the soul of Stoicism became more
humane and its form more graceful, gained the friendship of Laelius,
and through him of Scipio Aemilianus, whom he accompanied on the
mission which the conqueror of Carthage undertook to the kings of
Egypt and Asia in alliance with the republic. The foreign philosophy
was next admitted to mould the most characteristic of all the produc·
tions of the Roman mind-its jurispnrdence, being embraced byalong
line of illustrious legists ς 3ηά the relative duties of civil life were
defined and limited by conceptions borrowed from Stoic morality. It
was indeed a doctrine which, as soon as the national prejudice against
imported novelties and a systematic cultivation had been surmounted,
was sure to prove itself congenial to the stricmess and practicality of the Ι
