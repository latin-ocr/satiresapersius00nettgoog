ally undergoing a change. The theoretic parts of the system, its
physics and its dialectics, had found comparatively little favour with the
Roman mind, and had passed into the shade in consequence: but it was
still aforeign product, a matter of learning, the subjectos a voluminous
literature, and as such adiscipline to which only the few could submit.
It was still the old conception of the wise man asan ideal rather thana
· reality, a being necessarily perfect, and therefore necessarily super·
human. Now, however, the ancient exclusiveness was to be relaxed,
and the invitation to humanity made more general. ‘Strange and
shocking would it bel said Musonius Rufus, the one philosopher
exempted from Vespasian’s sentence, ‘if the tillers of the ground were
incapacitated from philosophy, which is really a business of few wordS,
not of many theories, and far better learnt inapractical countrylife than
in the schools of the city! In short, it was to be no longer a philosophy
hut a religion. Epictetus, the poor crippled slave, as his epitaph pro·
claims him, whom the gods loved, turned Theism from a speculative
dogma into anoperative principle, bidding his disciples follow the divine
service, imitate the divine life, implore the divine aid, and rest on the
divine providence. Dependence on the Deity was taught asa corre·
lative to independence of external circumstances and the ancient pride
of the Porch exchanged for a humility so genuine that men have en-
deavoured to tracc it horne to a Christian congregation. A Stoic thus
schooled was not likely to become apolitical propagandist, even if the
memory of the republic had been fresh, and the imperial power had

Ι continued to be synonymous with tyranny—much less after the assas·
· sination of Domitian had inaugurated an cpoch of which Tacitus could

speak as the fulfilment of the brightest dreams of the truest lovers of
freedom. Fifty years rolled away, and government became continually
better, and the pursuit of wisdom more and more honourable, till at
last the ideal of Zeno himself was realized, and a Stoic ascended the
¹throne of the Caesars, and the philosophy of political despair seemed to
have become the creed of political hope. The character of Marcus
Aurelius is one that is ever good to dwell on, and our sympathies
cling round the man that could be rigorously severe to himself while

tenderly indulgent to his people, whose love broke out in their fond
addresses to him as their father and-their brother: yet the peace of
his reign was blasted by natural calamities, torn by civil discord,
and tainted by the corruption of his own house, and at his death
the fair promise of the commonwealth and of philosophy expired
together. Commodus ruled the Roman world, and Stoicism, the
noblest of the latter systems, fell the first before the struggles of
