LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxi

old Roman character ; and when in the last struggles oi the common·

wealth the younger Cato endeavoured to talre up the position of his
great ancestor as a reformet of manners, his rule of life was derived not
only from the traditions of undegenerate antiquity, but from the precepts
os Antipater and Athenodorus. The lesson was one not tobe soon lost.
At the extinction of the republic, Stoicism lived on at Rome under the
imperial shadow, and the government of Augustus is said to have been
rendered milder by the counsels of one of its professors; but when
the pressure of an undisguised despotism began to call out the old
republican feeling, the elective affinity was seen to assert itself again.
This was the complexion of things which Persius found, and which he
left. That sect, as the accuser of Thrasea reminded the emperor, had
produced bad citizens even under the former rlgime: its present ad·
herents were men whose very deportment was an implied rebulre to the
habits of the imperial court; its chief representative bad abdicated his
official duties and retired into an unpatriotic and insulting privacy3 and
the public records of the administration of affairs at home and abroad
were only so many registers olbis sins oi omission. · There was, in
truth, no encouragement to pursuea different course. Seneca's attempt
to seat philosophy on the throne by influencing the mind of Nero, had
issued only in his own moral degradation as the lying apologist of
matricide, and the receiver ofa bounty which in one of its aspects was
plunder, in another corruption 3 and though his retirement, and still more
his death, may have sufficed to rescue his memory from obloquy, they
could only prove that he had learned too late what the more consistent
members of the fraternity knew from the beginning. From such a
government the only notice that a Stoic could expect or desire was the
sentence which hurried him to execution or drove him into banishment.
Even under the rule of Vespasian the antagonism was still unabated.
At the moment ofhis accession, Euphrates the Tyrian, who was in his
train, protested against the ambition which sought to aggrandize itself
when it might have restored the republic. Helvidius Priscus, following,
and perhaps deforming, the footsteps of his father-in·law Thrasea,
ignored the political existence of the emperor in his edicts as praetor,
and asserted his own equality repeatedly by a freedom of speech
amounting to personal insult, till at last he succeeded in exhausting
the forbearance of Vespasian, who put him to death and banished
the philosophers from Italy. A similar expulsion took place under
Domitian, who did not require much persuasion to induce him to
adopt a policy recommended by the instinct of seli-preservation no less
than by Nero's example. Meantime the spirit of Stoicism was gradu·
