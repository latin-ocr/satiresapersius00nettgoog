LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxiii

the enleebled yet resisting rivals, andthe victorious advances os a
new and living saith.
It is not osten that a poet hasbeen so completely identified with a
,ι system ol philosophy as Persius. Greece had produced poets who
were philosophers, and philosophers who were writers os poetry; yet
our first thought ol Aeschylus is not as ol a Pythagorean, or ol
Euripides as of a follower of the Sophisls; nor should we classily
Xenophanes or Empedocles primarily as poets of whose writings only
fragments remain. In Lucretius and Persius, on the other hand, we
see men who hold a prominent place among the poets of their country,
yet whose poetry is devoted to the eniorcement of their peculiar philo-
sophical views. The fact is a significant one, and symptomatic of that
condition of Roman culture which I have noticed on aformer occasion.
It points to an age and nation where philosophy is a permanent, not
a progressive study-an imported commodity, not an indigenous
growth‚—where the impulse that gives rise to poetry is not so much
a desire to give musical voice to the native thought and feeling ol the
poet and his lellow·men, as a recognition of the wantos a national
literature and a wish to contribute towards its supply. At first sight
there may seem something extravagant in pretending that Persius can
be called the poet of Stoicism in the sense in which Lucretius is the
poet os Epicureanism, as if there were equal scope for the-exposition
of a philosophy in a few scholastic exercises andin an elaborate
didactic poem. On the other hand, it should be recollected that
under the iron grasp of the Roman mind, Stoicism, as was just now
remarked, was being reduced more and more to a simply practical
system, bearing but a saint impress of those abstruse cosmological
speculations which had so great a charrn for the intellect of Greece
even in its most sober momentS, and exhibiting in place of theman
applicability to civil life the want of which had been noted as a desect
in the conceptions of Zeno and Chrysippus ¹. The library and the

lecture-roem still were more familiar to it than the sorum or the
senate ; but the transition had begun: and though Persius may have

looked to his seven hundred volumes sorbis principles os action, as he
did to Horace sor information about the ways of the world, the only
theory which he strove to inculcate was the knowledge which the
founders of his sect, in common with Socrates, believed to be the sole
groundwork of correct practice. Using the very words of Virgil, he

calls upon abenighted race to acquaint itself with the causes of things:
