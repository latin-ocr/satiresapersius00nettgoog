PREFACE. ix

latter at pp. 353 foll, by Μ. D. B. The Persius collation is
very scanty and not always accurate: but it appears to be the
only one known to Jahn. Mr. Bradshaw refers the MS. to
the twelfth or thirteenth century, almost certainly the former!
The other MS. in the Gale collection is referred by Mr.
Bradshaw to the ninth or tenth century, and is the most valu-
able of the seven MSS. collated. It consists ol one hundred
and ten folios in quires of eight, beginning on the second solio
of the first quire, and contains Juvenalts Satr'rae 1, Anaatatia
Cornuti 93, Persii Satirarum Praemium 94 verso, Persii
Satiraa 95. ‘It appears’ (Ι quote from Mr. Conington) ‘to
’ be written throughout in the same hand, the glosses being
written in amuch smaller character. The only doubt is about
certain glosses on the margin of the first sour pages of the
Persius (fol. 94 versa to fol. 96), where the letters are tall and
thin, not, as generally, broad and flat. The characters how-
ever, appear to be the same. There are other glosseS, appa·
rently written at the same time as the text and in the same
hand, some between the lineS, some towards the margin, evi·
dently earlier than those just spoken of, which in one place
leave a space in the middle of a line for an intrusive word of
theearlier gloss written out of the straight line. These earlier
glosses are much less copious than the later: they extend,
however, somewhat further, to solio 98, the end of Sat. 1,
after which they almost disappear, scarcely averaging one in
a page ²! The chief peculiarity of the writing of this MS.
(which Ι have myself collated with Jahn’s text of 1868) is the

shape of r, which is so formed as to be easily confused with n.

I initial is often written tall, so that in Sat. 4. 35 it is not at
