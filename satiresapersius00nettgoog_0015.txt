viii PREFACE.

is it always possible to know how he would have finally de-
cided in doubtful cases of reading oros interpretation, or in
what form he would have put the last touch to the less finished
portions. I have, in several instances, added to the notes a
reference to works now recognized as of standard authority,
which had not appeared at the time when the commentary was
written. Some parallel passages and illustrations l added for
the first edition, and have increased their number for the
second, enclosing all additions in square brackets [ ]. The

of Persius, two of which are in the Gale collection in the
library of Trinity College, Cambridge. One of these is known
as Bentley's Codex Galeanus‚ and is lettered y by Jahn in
his edition of 1843. ‘It is,' says Mt. Conington in his de-
scription of it, ‘a small vellum MS. of the 8vo or lamo size.
It contains Horatii Opera, Persii Satirar, Tlreadalr‘ Eclagae,
Cata de Moribus, and Aviani Fabulae. Collations of the
Avianus the Persius, and the Cato, were published in the
Classical Journal, vol. 4, the lormer at pp. 120 foll, the two
