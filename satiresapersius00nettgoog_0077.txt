iratum Eupolidem praegrandi cum sene palles,

aspice et haec, si forte aliquid decoctius audis. 125
inde vaporata lector mihi ferveat aure:

non hic, qui in crepidas Graiorum ludere gestit

sordidus, et lusco qui possit dicere ‘lusce’

sese aliquem credens, Italo quod honore supinus

fregerit eminas Arreti aedilis iniquas3

nec qui abaco numeros et secto in pulvere metas

scit risisse vafer, multum gaudere paratus,

si cynico barbam petulans nonaria vellat.
