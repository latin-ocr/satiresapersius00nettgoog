LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxxiii

worldly knowledge would have led him to correct his error of J'udg·
ment, though the history of English authors show us, in at least one
instance, that of Ben Jonson, that a man, not only ol true comic genius
hut of large experiences of life, may be so enslaved by acquired learning
as to satirize vice and folly as he reads of them in his books, rather
than as he sees them in society.

But time warns me that Ι must leave the yet unfinished list of the
influences which worked or may have worked upon Persius and say a
few words upon his actual merits as a writer. The tendency ol what
has been advanced hitherto has been to make us think of him as more
passive than active—as a candidate more for our interest and our
sympathy than for our admiration. But we must not forget that it
is his own excellence that bas made him a classic-that the great and
true glory which, as Quintilian says, he gained by a single volume, has
been due to that volume alone. If we would justisy the award of his
contemporaries and of posterity, we may be prepared to account for it.

It was not, as we have seen, that he was an originating power in philo· .
sophy, or a many-sided observer of men and manners He was a
satirist, but he shows no knowledge of many of the ingredients whic

which, later if not sooner, must have told latally on an otherwise uri-
supported reputation. I might add that he is frequently perplexedin
arrangement and habitually obscure in meaning, were it not that some
judges have professed to discover in this the secret of his fame. A Ι
truer appreciation will, I believe, be more likely to find it in the distinct

and individual character of his writings, the power of mind and depth

of feeling visible throughout, the austere purity of bis moral tone„¹
relieved by frequent outbreaks of genial humour, and the condensedj
vigour and graphic freshness of a style where elaborate art seems to be ’
only natiue triumphing over obstacles. Probably no writer ever ζ
borrowed so much and yet left on the mind so decided an impression l
or originaria. His· description or tue wilful invare anu urs medicari
friend in the third satire owes much of its colouring to Horace, yet the

Evcn when the picture is entirely Horatian, like that of the over·
covetous man at his prayers, in the second satire,¹ the effect is original
still, though the very varieties which discriminate it may be referred to
hints in other parts of Horace's own works. We may wish that hc
had painted from his own observation and knowledge, but we cannot
deny that he has shown a painters power. And where he drawa the
